# Student-Frontend

This is the front end build for the
[Student-bakend](https://github.com/abhisekmohantychinua/student-backend.git).This
is made with React+Typescript with command
`npx create-react-app student-frontend --template typescript`. This is
completely made for fun and learning purpose.Though I am not good at frontend
designing and styling I have tried to use it effectively.Extra 3 packages i have
installed locally for this project `Axios,React-Bootstrap,React-Icons`. Axios is
used to send **Request** and recieve **Response** from backend.Bootstrap and
React Icons are well known for styling.

## How to start the app?

Pull branch from Github to local repository and go inside the app and run
`npm start` to start the app.

> **Note** : Backend app must runing in the background.To run it check
